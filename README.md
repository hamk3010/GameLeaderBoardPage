# GameLeaderBoardPage
- Developed a boiler plate score keeping template
- Used Meteor.js with React, ES6, and SCSS
- Score keeper allows the user to add, remove, and update player score, manually. The idea behind this page is to be used with other gaming web apps, to display the results of changing player scores.
